mvn clean install -X


# UFO Sightings Service

We have a huge TSV file (included in the project resources folder) and we need to consume the information inside it.
We have provided a simple interface (UfoSightingService) and would like you provide an implementation for it.
  


### First Objective
- Write an implementation of the UfoSightingService interface that fulfill the requirements in the javadocs present on it.
- Searching the sighting happened on October 1995 should return 107 sightings
- Searching all the sightings should return 61391 results


### Second objective
Optimize it to be as fast as it can be

### Constraints
- UfoSighting DTO and UfoSightingService interface cannot be changed
- TSV File cannot be altered
- Usage of multithreading is not allowed

### What are we looking for

- Clean code
- Unit testing
- Your comments on what you would change on the interface and DTO


### Suggestions
Keep it simple
You can use any Java version

You can use any library available on internet but none should be necessary




### How to submit the code

Git Pull on our repo 

**OR** via mail but make sure to

Clean the project (don't submit the target folder)

Remove the tsv file (Limited inbox, sorry)
